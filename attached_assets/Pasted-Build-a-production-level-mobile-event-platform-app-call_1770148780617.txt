Build a production-level mobile event platform app called Stress Congress 2026 using React Native with Expo for iOS and Android and a Node.js + Express backend hosted on Replit.

The app must be professional, colorful, smooth, interactive, and suitable for a real conference event.

🎯 APP PURPOSE

This app is for a real event happening on March 3, 2026.
